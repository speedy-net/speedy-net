## How to setup the project and run locally

First make sure that you're using Python 3.11 or later (we recommend the latest Python version).

Then, you'll want to create a virtualenv and activate. You create virtualenv once and activate it each time you start to work on the project.

    python3.11 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows Git Bash (MINGW64)
    source .venv/bin/activate   # *.nix

Next:

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
    cp env.ini.example env.ini

You may want to edit [**env.ini**](#envini) to specify database settings, secret keys for third party services or other stuff.

Then you can run migrations:

    cd speedy/net
    ./manage.py migrate
    cd speedy/match
    ./manage.py migrate
    cd speedy/core
    ./manage.py load_data fixtures/default_sites_local.json

To run Speedy Net server:

    cd speedy/net
    ./manage.py run_server 8010

To run Speedy Match server:

    cd speedy/match
    ./manage.py run_server 8020

To install the requirements for tests:

    pip install --upgrade -r tests-requirements.txt

To run Speedy Net tests:

    cd speedy/net
    ./tests_manage.py test

To run Speedy Match tests:

    cd speedy/match
    ./tests_manage.py test

To run tests with all warnings (in any directory):

    python -W error tests_manage.py test

You need to run both Speedy Net and Speedy Match in parallel in separate console tabs.

Use the following URLs to access the websites:

    http://www.speedy.net.localhost:8010/
    http://www.speedy.match.localhost:8020/
    http://www.speedy.composer.localhost:8030/
    http://www.speedy.mail.software.localhost:8040/

### Build frontend

The project uses Bootstrap 4 with [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com). `css` are compiled from `scss`.

You need to setup [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). To install build tools run:

    npm install --global gulp-cli
    npm install

Then:

    gulp

Will compile static files.

**Please notice** - gulp doesn't work if you have spaces in folder names in your directory tree. All file and folder names cannot contain spaces.

## How to setup the project and run locally (with docker-compose)

    docker-compose up
    docker-compose run --rm match all migrate
    docker-compose run --rm net load_data speedy/core/fixtures/default_sites_local.json


## How to setup a server (Ubuntu 22.04)

Install all dependencies using **apt-get**:

    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main"
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install python3.11 python3-pip python3.11-venv python3.11-dev  # common python stuff
    sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev  # pillow dependencies
    sudo apt-get install postgresql-15 postgresql-client-15 postgresql-server-dev-15 nginx uwsgi uwsgi-src postfix memcached

In **/etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf** change the lines:

    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
    host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
to

    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
    host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust

And add under # Database administrative login by Unix domain socket:

    local   all             speedy_net                              trust

below the line:

    local   all             postgres                                peer

Restart **postgresql**:

    sudo service postgresql restart

Setup a database:

    sudo -i -u postgres
    createuser speedy_net
    createdb -O speedy_net speedy_net
    exit

Build **uwsgi** plugin:

    PYTHON=python3.11 uwsgi --build-plugin "/usr/src/uwsgi/plugins/python python311"
    mv python311_plugin.so /usr/lib/uwsgi/plugins

Clone the project, create a venv, activate it and install required modules using **pip**:

    git clone https://github.com/speedy-net/speedy-net.git
    cd speedy-net/
    python3.11 -m venv env

Copy **env.ini.example** to **env.ini**:

    cp env.ini.example env.ini

Change **env.ini** appropriately. Refer to [**env.ini** section](#envini) of this document. `DATABASE_URL` should be like `postgres://speedy_net@127.0.0.1:5432/speedy_net`

Copy sample **nginx** and **uwsgi** configs:

    cd ~/speedy-net/
    sudo cp contrib/uwsgi/*.ini /etc/uwsgi/apps-available/
    sudo cp contrib/nginx/*.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/

Copy **logrotate** config:

    sudo cp contrib/logrotate.d/speedy /etc/logrotate.d/
    sudo chmod 644 /etc/logrotate.d/speedy

Remove default **nginx** config:

     sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Install **systemd** service to create required directories on boot (optional):

    sudo cp contrib/prepare-uwsgi.service /lib/systemd/system/
    sudo systemctl enable prepare-uwsgi

Review and edit these config files, restart servers:

    sudo service uwsgi restart
    sudo service nginx restart

Run migrations and collect static:

    contrib/deploy.sh

You must run the following commands, according to https://stackoverflow.com/a/54253374/57952:

    /home/ubuntu/speedy-net/env/bin/pip uninstall psycopg2
    /home/ubuntu/speedy-net/env/bin/pip install --no-binary :all: psycopg2==2.9.9

Run again **contrib/deploy.sh**:

    contrib/deploy.sh

Reboot the server and check that everything works:

    sudo reboot


## How to create an admin user

    from speedy.net.accounts.models import User
    from django.utils.timezone import now
    u = User()
    u.username = 'admin'
    u.slug = 'admin'
    u.date_of_birth = now()
    u.gender = User.GENDER_OTHER
    u.first_name = 'admin'
    u.last_name = 'admin'
    u.is_staff = True
    u.is_superuser = True
    u.special_username = True
    u.set_password('<PASSWORD>')
    u.save()


## env.ini

**env.ini** file is where you should store all your credentials and secret keys. It must not to be checked into VCS.

Available settings:

* `ENVIRONMENT` defines which of the settings files should be used. They are located in `speedy/net/settings` and `speedy/match/settings`. *Examples*: `development`, `staging` or `production`.
* `TESTS_ENVIRONMENT` defines which of the settings files should be used for tests. *Example*: `tests`.
* `SECRET_KEY` is a random string. [More on Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#secret-key). *Example*: `s3cr37k3Y***`
* `IPAPI_API_ACCESS_KEY` - access key for https://api.ipapi.com/
* `DATABASE_URL` contains the settings for default database. *Examples*: look [dj-database-url docs](https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url#url-schema)
* `CACHE_URL` contains the settings for default caching backend. *Examples*: look [django-cache-url docs](https://github.com/ghickman/django-cache-url#supported-caches)
