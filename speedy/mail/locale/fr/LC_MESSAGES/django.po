"Speedy Mail Software will be a free software and open source web-based email "
"such as Gmail. We want the mail to be as similar as possible to the "
"excellent email of Google, Gmail. When we develop such a mail software, we "
"intend to run a free email service to all members of Speedy Net, so that the "
"username of each person at Speedy Net + the speedy.net domain name will be "
"the email address of the user. In the past we operated an email like this, "
"but unfortunately we had to close it because it was a lot worse than Gmail, "
"in terms of features and storage, and also because we were not able to "
"control the problem of spam (\"junk mail\") sent to our clients. But if we "
"can recruit volunteers to create a good email program, we will reactivate "
"Speedy Mail and will allow any company or organization to operate a similar "
"web-based email on their site."
