"Thank you for your interest in Speedy Composer. Speedy Composer is an "
"automated application for composing melodies for Speedy Net members. We "
"recently made changes to the source code of Speedy Net, and converted it "
"into the Python language and Django framework. Since Speedy Composer was "
"originally written in PHP, it is not adapted to work with Speedy Net in its "
"current form. So unfortunately we were forced to temporarily close the app "
"Speedy Composer. But don't worry, we kept backups of all the tunes composed "
"by Speedy Composer, and when the website is reopened we will upload them to "
"the new site."
